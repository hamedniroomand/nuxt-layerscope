# Releasing

`nuxt-layerscope` is published to npm by `.github/workflows/release.yml` when a `v*` tag is
pushed. The workflow uses [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers):
GitHub Actions proves its identity to npm with OIDC, so no npm token is stored anywhere, and npm
adds [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) when the repository is
public.

A trusted publisher can only be configured for a package that exists, so the **first version is
published by hand**.

## First release (by hand)

### 1. Prepare

Keep the release workflow disabled for now (**Actions → Release → ⋯ → Disable workflow**), so the
tag pushed below does not try to publish a second time.

```bash
git switch main && git pull
vp install
vp run ready
```

Check the version in `packages/layerscope/package.json` and that `CHANGELOG.md` has a section for
it.

### 2. Publish

Pack with pnpm, which replaces the workspace's `catalog:` specifiers, then publish the tarball with
npm, exactly as the workflow does:

```bash
cd packages/layerscope
vp pm pack --pack-destination ../../.release
npm login
npm publish ../../.release/nuxt-layerscope-0.1.0.tgz --access public
rm -r ../../.release
```

npm asks for a second factor. Check the result with `npm view nuxt-layerscope`.

### 3. Tag and release on GitHub

The action is referenced by tag (`hamedniroomand/nuxt-layerscope@v0.1.0`), so the tag is needed
even though the workflow did not publish:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
gh release create v0.1.0 --title v0.1.0 --notes "See CHANGELOG.md"
```

### 4. Connect the repository to npm

On [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-layerscope), open **Settings → Trusted
publishing**, choose **GitHub Actions** and enter:

| Field                | Value             |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Organization or user | `hamedniroomand`  |
| Repository           | `nuxt-layerscope` |
| Workflow filename    | `release.yml`     |
| Environment name     | `npm`             |

The environment must match `environment: npm` in the workflow. Create it on GitHub under
**Settings → Environments**; protection rules there (required reviewers, only `v*` tags) then
apply to every publish.

Once a release has gone through the workflow, restrict publishing on npm under **Settings →
Publishing access → Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens**. Trusted publishing
keeps working, and a leaked token can no longer publish.

### 5. Enable the workflow

**Actions → Release → Enable workflow.**

## Every later release

1. Update `version` in `packages/layerscope/package.json` and rename the `## Unreleased` section
   of `packages/layerscope/CHANGELOG.md` to `## <version>`. Changes merged between releases add
   their line under `## Unreleased`.
2. Commit and merge to `main`.
3. Tag and push:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```

The workflow then:

1. checks that the tag matches the package version,
2. runs `vp run ready` (format, lint, type check, tests, build),
3. packs the package with pnpm and publishes it with npm 11.5.1 or later through trusted
   publishing,
4. creates the GitHub release from the changelog section.

A tag with a pre-release suffix, such as `v0.2.0-beta.1`, is published under the `next`
dist-tag and marked as a pre-release on GitHub.
